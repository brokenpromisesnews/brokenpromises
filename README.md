Keeping our leaders accountable.

Broken Promises is a non-partisan site that tracks the false claims of both future and past actions that many politicians are notorious for making.

As the incoming US President, we've chosen Donald Trump as the primary subject to begin our analysis.

BP performs some similar functions to other political fact checkers, but with several key differences:

* A focus on "claims of action". Such as "I will do X" or "I did Y"
* Crowd-sourced debate on the legitimacy of claims
* Open Source

## Criteria for inclusion

Our core belief is that all "truth" analysis must be done transparently and in the open.

To be listed on this site, a false claim must:

* Have verifiable sources (preferably multiple) of a claim made by the person in question
* The claim must be testable
* Have verifiable sources refuting the claim

Exactly what constitutes "acceptable" sources is up for debate. But as a guiding principal, refer to Wikipedia's [Citing Sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)

## How to contribute

This site and repository uses the standardize Github workflow.

1. Submit a pull request with the changes you feel
2. New content (such as adding a new false claim) should follow examples of formatting from previous
3. Moderators and maintainers make the final determination on includability
4. Pull request is merged
5. Site is auto-built and deployed

## Work to be done

Help would be appreciated in the following areas:

* Improved design
* Consistent template for each analysis
* Expand to other politicians with bad track records
* Build a framework for how to analyze long-term track records and frequency of lies/truth
