## The Claim

Donald Trump said on December 31, 2016 he knows "things that other people don't know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation."  When asked for details by a reporter Trump said, "You'll find out Tuesday or Wednesday."

## The Broken Promise

Trump did no reveal any further information in the next several days.
